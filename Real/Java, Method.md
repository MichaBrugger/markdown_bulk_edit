A method, also known as a function, is a block of code which only runs when it is [[Brain/Java, Calling a Method|called]]. You can pass data, known as [[Java, Parameter|parameters]], into a method.[^1] Methods implement the 'behaviour' of [[Java, Object|objects]]. They consist of a [[Java, Method Head|head]] and a [[Java, Method Body|body]].[^2]

When a method from within the same class is called, it's called an _internal method call_, else it's an _external method call_.[^3]
