# Blue Ocean

Blue oceans are [[Market, New|new]], [[Market, Uncontested|uncontested]] market spaces where the competition is irrelevant. In blue oceans, you invent and capture new demand, and you offer customers a [[Value, Creation|leap in value]] while also streamlining your costs. Results? Handsome profits, speedy [[Business, Growth|growth]] â€“ and [[Brand|brand equity]] that lasts for decades while rivals scramble to catch up.[^1]
