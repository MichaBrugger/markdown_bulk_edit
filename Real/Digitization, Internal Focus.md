# Internal Focus, or Automation Focus

Historically the oldest [[Digitization, Dimensions|dimension]]. Its core idea is to [[Automation|automate]] repetitive tasks in order to improve [[Efficiency|efficiency]] and thus its competitiveness. Always focusing on the [[Return on Investment|return on investment]]. An example for a company coming from this area would be [[SAP]] (automation of routine work).[^1]

However, there are certain implications/problems with this approach. They are great to increase [[Efficiency|efficiency|]], given the context is within one generation of technology and that the company keeps doing what it has done before (doesn't change its [[Structure, organisational|structure]]). Else, focusing on this approach might lead to [[System, Legacy|legacy systems]] since it's often hard to justify an [[Investment|investment]] into completely new systems.

Given the [[Automation, Marginal Utility|declining ROI on automation]], the endgame of internal digitization processes are generally an intelligent partial automation.[^2]
