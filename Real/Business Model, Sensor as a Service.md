# Sensor as a Service

The use of sensors permits [[Service, Added|additional services]] for physical offerings, or wholly new independent services. It is not the sensor that generates the primary revenue, but the [[Data, Analytics|analysis of the data]] that the sensor creates. Possibilities for [[Information, Real-Time|real-time information]] can further strengthen the [[Customer Value Proposition|value proposition]].[^1]

Often in combination with the [[Internet of Things]].

## Notes

Check potential relation to [[Service, Bundling]].
