# Blue Ocean Strategy, Logic

_It’s not about technology innovation._ Blue oceans seldom result from technological innovation. Often, the underlying technology already exists – and blue ocean creators link it to what [[Customer, Demand|buyers value]]. [[Compaq]], for example, used existing technologies to create its ProSignia server, which gave buyers twice the file and print capability of the minicomputer at one-third the price.

_You don’t have to venture into distant waters to create blue oceans_. Most blue oceans are created from within, not beyond, the red oceans of existing industries. Incumbents often create blue oceans within their [[Business, Core|core businesses]]. Consider the megaplexes introduced by [[AMC]] – an established player in the movie-theater industry. Megaplexes provided movie-goers spectacular viewing experiences in stadium-size theater complexes at lower costs to theater owners.[^1]

## Notes

In a way the example of AMC could also be seen as [[Business Model, Experience Selling|selling new experiences]].
