Those are surprisingly hard to define. Many websites don't have authors, so I get a lot of "unknown" keys. I really want a [[Database, Unique Key|unique key]]. So, [[2022-01-12|today]] I decided to go with a 'dateAdded' based key + title.

`[DateAdded:format-date=%Y%m%d]-[DateAdded:format-date=%H%M]-[shorttitle4_4]`

The full documentation for Better BibTex can be found [here](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/citing/).

Old format:

`[authEtAl:lower:default=unknown][year:default=00][shorttitle4_4]`
