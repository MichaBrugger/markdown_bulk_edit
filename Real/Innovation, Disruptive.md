# Innovation, Disruptive

A [[Market, Disruption|disruptive]] [[Innovation|innovation]] is a [[Innovation, Process|process]] whereby a smaller company with fewer resources challenges an established incumbent.

A radical [[Innovation|innovation]] that makes an existing [[Technology|technology]], [[Product|product]] or [[Service|service]] obsolete.

[[The Disruptive Innovation Model|Disruptive Innovation]] generally starts from one of two footholds:

- [[Foothold, Low-End]] / [[Customer Expectations]]
- [[Foothold, New Market]] / [[Blue Ocean]]

## Notes

The 'overshooting' approach has once again a strong relation to the whole [[Customer Expectations]] idea. The value created is outside of the customers expectation thresholds and thus doesn't add any value anymore. #ðŸŒ±
