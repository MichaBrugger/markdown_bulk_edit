# Two-Sided-Market

A Two-Sided Market facilitates interactions between multiple interdependent [[Group|groups]] of customers. The [[Network Effect|value of the platform increases]] as more groups or individual members use it. The two sides usually come from distinguished groups, e.g., businesses and private interest.[^1]

Once again, a strong correlation with the classic business models of the [[Corporation, Digital|tech industry]].
