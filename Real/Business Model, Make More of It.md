# Business Model, Make More of It

[[Asset, Know-How|Know-how]] and other available [[Asset|assets]] existing in the company are not only used to build own products, but are also offered to other companies. Slack [[|resources]], therefore, can be used to create [[Revenue, Added|additional revenue]] besides that which is generated directly from the core [[Customer Value Proposition|value proposition]] of the company.[^1]

## Notes

There is a potential connection to the [[Business Model, Franchising|franchise model]] here, regarding the sharing of [[Business, Know-How|know-how]].
