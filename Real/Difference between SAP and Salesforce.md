# Difference Between SAP and Salesforce

[[SAP]] is a great example of a company that enables other companies to be more efficient, thus helping many to develop further [[Digitization, Internal Focus|along the first axis of digitization]]. SAP is extremely complex, but still manages to be excellent regarding [[Performance|performance]].

And here lies the core difference between SAP and [[Salesforce]]. SAP was never built with [[User Centricity|user centricity]] in mind, it was built and optimised for companies. So, even though Salesforce is the technically worse solution and arguably less useful for the company as an entity, it is generally favoured by its actual users and thus gets bought more. This can be seen directly in the [[Business, Growth|companies' growth]] numbers: Salesforce is 3x bigger than SAP and grows 3x faster, too. This is a great example for the [[User is King]] logic.[^1]

## Notes

An interesting thought here: This is a very similar phenomenon like the discussion in [[Computer Science|computer science]] around code that is optimised to be read by a computer vs. computer that is meant to be read by a human. This is also discussed by [[20220104-0729-ProgrammingAlgorithmsHardProblems||Donald Knuth and Lex Fridman]] in their podcast. Knuth then references the concept of [[Literate Programming|literate programming]], which proposes to write code as a mix between traditional [[Language|language]] and traditional [[Source Code|source Code]].
