# Intelligence, Evolution

## Hypothesis

Intelligence is converging from the intelligence of the individual towards the intelligence of the [[Intelligence, Collective|group]]. This thought came to me while hearing podcasts of [[Fridman, Lex|Lex Fridman]] with [[Knuth, Donald|Donald Knuth]] [^1] and [[Hawkins, Jeff|Jeff Hawkins]].[^2] It's something that can be observed when looking at the evolution of corporations.
