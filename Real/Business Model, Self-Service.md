# Self-Service

A part of the [[Value, Creation|value creation]] is handed over to the [[Customer|customer]] in exchange for a [[Price, Low|lower price]] of the [[Goods|service or product]]. This is particularly suited for [[Business, Process|process]] steps that add relatively low [[Value, Perceived|perceived value]] for the customer but cause [[Cost|high costs]]. Customers benefit from [[Efficiency|efficiency]] and time savings, while putting in their own effort. This can also increase efficiency, because in some cases the customer can execute a [[Value, Added|value adding]] step quicker and more effectively than the company.[^1]
