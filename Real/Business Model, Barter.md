# Business Model, Barter

Barter is a method of exchange in which [[Goods|goods]] are given away to [[Customer|customers]] without the transaction of actual money. In return, they provide something of value to the sponsoring organisation. The exchange does not have to show any direct connection and is valued differently by each party.[^1]
