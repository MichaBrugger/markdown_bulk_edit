# Difference Between Open and Closed Innovation

[[Open Innovation]] comes from [[Closed Innovation]]

The [[Closed Innovation|traditional innovation process]] is closed because projects can only enter it in one way, at the beginning from the companyâ€™s internal base, and can only exit in one way, by going into the [[Market|market]]. In the [[Open Innovation|open innovation model]], by contrast, projects may enter or exit at various points and in various ways. Here, projects can be launched from either internal or external technology sources, and [[Technology, New|new technology]] can enter into the process at various stagesâ€”the [[Open Innovation, Outside-In Perspective|outside-in]] portion of the model. In addition, projects can make their way to market in many ways as well, such as through out-licensing or via a [[Spinn-Off|spin-off]] venture company, in addition to going through the companyâ€™s own marketing and sales channels. This is the [[Open Innovation, Inside-Out Perspective|inside-out]] part of the model.
