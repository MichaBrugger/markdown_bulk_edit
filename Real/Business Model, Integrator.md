# Business Model, Integrator

An Integrator is in command of the bulk of steps in the [[Value, Added|value-adding]] [[Business, Process|process]]. The control of all [[Resource|resources]] and capabilities in terms of [[Value, Creation|value creation]] lies with the company. [[Efficiency, Gain|Efficiency gains]], [[Economies of Scope|economies of scope]] and [[Supplier, Dependency|low dependencies from suppliers]] result in a [[Cost, Reduction|decrease of costs]] and can increase the stability of the value creation.[^2]

## Notes

An example for an integrator would be Fords Model T, so there might also be a connection to the [[Blue Ocean Strategy]] here.
