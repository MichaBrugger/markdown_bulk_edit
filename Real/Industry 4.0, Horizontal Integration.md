# Industry 4.0, Horizontal Integration

Horizontal integration is one way to look at [[Industry 4.0]].

If everything is connected to everything else in [[Production|production]], and every [[Product|product]] I produce has a digital twin, then I'm able to optimise (seen over the whole [[Production, Process|production process]]). Currently, many companies only look at efficiency in one production facility, if the process is digital, it allows to increase efficiency horizontally (across production facilities). [^1]
