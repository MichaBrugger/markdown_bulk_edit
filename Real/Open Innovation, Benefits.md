# Open Innovation, Benefits

[[Open Innovation, Outside-In Perspective]]:
Enables [[Cost, Reduction]] because one can leverage the work of others (Connection to [[Business Model, Crowdsourcing|Crowdsourcing]]?). (Context: [[Research and Development]]) Another benefit is speed/time-savings because one can start where others left off ([[Efficiency]]).

[[Open Innovation, Inside-Out Perspective]]: By sharing ideas and technologies one can construct [[Value Chain]], attracting new people from [[Ecosystem, Business]]. Another benefit is potentially royalties from other industries that the company could have never covered themselves anyway (maybe somewhat related to [[Business Model, Licensing]] or [[Business Model, Franchising]]). [[Research and Development]] is more economically sustainable.
