# Difference Between Creative Destruction and Market Creation

But does [[Market, Creation]] always involve [[Creative Destruction|destruction]]? The answer is no. It also involves nondestructive creation, wherein new demand is created without displacing existing products or services. Example Viagra.

Many [[Strategy, Market-Creating|market-creating moves]] are nondestructive, because they offer solutions where none previously existed. Â 

Conflating market creation with creative destruction not only limits an organisation's set of opportunities but also sets off resistance to market-creating strategies. People in established companies typically don't like the notion of creative destruction or [[Market, Disruption|disruption]] because it may threaten their current status and jobs. As a result, managers often undermine their company's market-creating efforts by starving them of resources, allocating undue overhead costs to the initiatives, or not cooperating with the people working on them. It's critical for market creators to head this danger off early by clarifying that their project is at least as much about nondestructive creation as it is about disruption.[^1]
