# Difference Between Market-Creating Strategies and Cost Leadership

When organisations see [[Strategy, Market-Creating|market-creating strategies]] as solutions with [[Cost Leadership|low-cost strategies]] alone, they focus on what to eliminate and reduce in current offerings and largely ignore what they should improve or create to increase the offerings' value.

Our point, again, is that a market-creating strategy takes a "both-and" approach: It pursues both differentiation and low cost. In this framework new market space is created not by pricing against the competition within an industry but by pricing against substitutes and alternatives that non-customers are currently using. Accordingly, a new market does not have to be created at the low end of an industry. Instead it can be created at the high end, as Cirque du Soleil did in circus entertainment, Starbucks did in coffee, and Dyson did in vacuum cleaners.[^1]
