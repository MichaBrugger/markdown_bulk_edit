# Business Model, Hidden Revenue

The logic that the [[User|user]] is responsible for the income of the business is abandoned. Instead, the main source of revenue comes from a third party, which [[Revenue,Â Cross-Financing|cross-finances]] whatever [[Price, Free|free]] or [[Price, Low|low-priced]] offering [[Business, Growth|attracts the users]]. A very common case of this model is financing through [[Advertisement|advertisement]], where the attracted [[Customer|customers]] are valuable to the advertisers who fund the offering.[^1]

This concept facilitates the idea of [[Seperation between Revenue and Customer|separation between revenue and customer]] and is closely related to [[Difference between Traditional and Digital Corporations|the business model]] of the [[Corporation, Digital|big tech companies]].
