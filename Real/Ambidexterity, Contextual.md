# Ambidexterity, Contextual

Contextual [[Ambidexterity|ambidexterity]] emphasises behavioural and social means to help individuals think and act ambidextrously within their daily actions to integrate exploration and exploitation. [[Value, Shared|Shared values]], [[Culture|culture]], and coordination play a significant role here.[^1]
