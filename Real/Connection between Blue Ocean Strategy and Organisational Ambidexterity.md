Both strategies nicely show the limitations/boundaries of the other one:

The [[Blue Ocean Strategy]] primarily focuses on [[Innovation, Explorative|exploration]] and neglects [[Innovation, Exploitative|exploitation]] strategies in the [[Innovation, Process|innovation process]].

[[Ambidexterity, Organisational|Organisational ambidexterity]] on the other hand is a very theoretical approach/concept without a detailed road-map how to navigate [[Business Innovation|business innovation]].
