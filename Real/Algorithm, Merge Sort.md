# Algorithm, Merge Sort

The merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, and comparison-based [[Algorithm, Sorting|sorting algorithm]]. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a [[Paradigm, Divide-and-Conquer|divide and conquer]] algorithm that was invented by [[John von Neumann|John von Neumann]] in 1945.
