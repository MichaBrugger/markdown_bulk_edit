A/B-Testing is often used to see what impact a specific feature has on the [[User, |user]]. This is often used by [[Corporation, Digital|tech companies]] for [[Product, Digital|digital goods]].[^1]

In the context of [[Digitization, Internal Focus|user focused digitization]] it unfortunately typically doesn't work since we would have to compare full products or services and not specific features.
