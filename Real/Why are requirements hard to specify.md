# Why Are Requirements Hard to Specify?

- Objectives/goals of the project aren't clear
- The task to be solved is very [[Complexity|complex]]
- [[Communication, Problem|Communication problems]] - There are [[Language, Barrier|language barriers]] between the different actors
- The objectives/goals of the project are constantly changing
- [[Requirements]] are poorly defined
- [[Gold-Plating]] - The [[Product|product]] has unnecessary features
- Inaccurate Planing and Tracking of the project due to inaccurate requirements.

To avoid these problems, we apply the techniques of [[Requirements Engineering]] and [[Requirements Management]].
