# Gains

Describe the outcomes customers want to achieve or the [[Customer, Benefit|concrete benefits]] they are seeking.[^1]

## Notes

The gains describe anything that the customer wants [[Customer, Demand|wants]] and needs, but are those two really necessarily the same? Maybe there should be a distinction here. This could also be split into: [[Requirements|requirements]], [[Customer Expectations|expectations]] and desires.[^2]
