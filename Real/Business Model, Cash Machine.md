# Business Model, Cash Machine

In the Cash Machine concept, the [[Customer|customer]] pays upfront for the [[Product|products]] sold to the customer before the company is able to cover the associated expenses. This results in increased liquidity, which can be used to amortise debt or to fund [[Investment|investments]] in other areas.[^1]
