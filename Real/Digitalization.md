# Digitalization

There doesn't seem to be an actual consensus when it comes to the definition of this word-cluster.

Wikipedia defines Digitalization as the process in which aspects of social life are restructured around digital communication. In this sense, digitalization refers to enabling or improving processes by leveraging [[Technology, Digital|digital technologies]] and digitised data. [^1] While in my lectures and on other sources, Digitalization refers to creating a digital representation of physical objects or attributes.[^2]

Then there is also the related [[Business Model, Digitalization|business model]] that is named the same. And it also [[Difference between Digitization, Digitalization, Digital Transformation and Industry 4.0|shouldn't be confused]] with Digitization. #♻️
