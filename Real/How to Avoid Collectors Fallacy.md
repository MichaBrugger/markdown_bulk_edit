# My Answer When Asked How to Avoid Collector's Fallacy?

Today, I saw a post on the Obsidian Discord channel from someone who apparently struggles with the exact same issues that I do: Collecting information for the sake of collecting it. Even though this topic is not at all ‚Äúfigured out‚Äù for me, I wrote him an explanation on my recent [[Learning|learnings]].

> I actually struggled with the exact same issue for the first half a year when I started using Obsidian. Realising it was the first step to adjust, so you're on the right path üòâ That being said, what really helped was having a name for it and doing some research to find out how to avoid it. As far as I know, it's often referred to as _Collector's Fallacy_ (I think, I heard that from [[Jenks, Bryan|Bryan Jenks]] first). Anyway, in the end, the solution is very much depending on you as an individual, but what helped me personally is making questions the central element of my system and not answers. To explain that: Let's say I'm wondering "what is an [[Atomic Notes|atomic note]]?":

> _The way I used to tackle that:_ I would consume some articles, videos, etc. and make a new note for every single one. But even though I linked the notes to each other and added new information to the system, I would actually lose the context of the information and basically create little "knowledge-islands" with no real entry point.

> _What I do now:_ I will create an actual note, simply called "What is an Atomic Note?". Then I would go on, consume the articles, etc. but instead of adding the information to the note of the article, I will add the important parts to the note of the question. So the note will basically contain something like: "What is an Atomic Note?" Author A says that it's X and Video B agrees with that, but Article C sees it slightly different and so on. This way, the new information is actually embedded in the context that "asked for it" in the first place. And next time I ask myself that question, I can literally search for it and start my knowledge from where I left off last time. In addition, I find that doing it that way, I actually focus a lot more on what is significant about that information for me, with a special emphasis on the for me part. Since in the end, the only person you create all this for is, you guessed it, yourself ü§ì

> Once these question notes grow large, I am usually already somewhat familiar with the topic. So at this point it's very easy to ‚Äúsplit off‚Äù subsections into their own notes (always linked to / embedded in the original question, of course). This process makes for a natural growth of topics around the actual questions I asked myself, and when I come back to the topic I find it much easier to understand both the flow and context of what I was thinking the last time I spent time on this topic.

I thought writing this down might also help me understand and memorise better what I learnt in my own process.
