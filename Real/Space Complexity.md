# Computer Science, Space Complexity

The space complexity of an [[Algorithm|algorithm]] or a computer program is the amount of [[Memory|memory]] space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely. Similar to [[Time Complexity|time complexity]], space complexity is often expressed asymptotically in [[Big O Notation|big O notation]], where n is a characteristic of the input influencing space complexity.
