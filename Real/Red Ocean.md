# Red Ocean

The term was coined in the context of the [[Blue Ocean Strategy]]. It describes existing [[Market|markets]] and [[Industry|industries]] that are relatively unattractive, because they are highly [[Market, Competitive|competitive]] and offer [[Margin, Low|small margins]]. In red oceans, companies try to out-perform rivals to grab bigger slices of existing demand. As the space gets increasingly crowded, [[Profit, Decrease|profit]] and [[Business, Growth|growth]] prospects shrink. Products become commoditised. Ever-more-intense competition turns the water bloody.[^1]
