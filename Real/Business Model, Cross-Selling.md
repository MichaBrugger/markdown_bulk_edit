# Business Model, Cross-Selling

In this model, [[Service|services]] or [[Product|products]] from a formerly excluded branch are added to the offerings, thus leveraging existing key skills and resources. In retail, especially, companies can easily provide [[Product, Additional|additional products]] and offerings that are not linked to the main branch on which they were previously focused. Thus, additional revenue can be generated with relatively few changes to the existing infrastructure and assets, since more potential customer needs are met.[^1]
