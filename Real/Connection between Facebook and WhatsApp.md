# Why Did Facebook Buy WhatsApp?

In 2014, [[Facebook]] bought [[WhatsApp]] for $17.2 Billion. The reason for that might be, that in 2012 [[Google]] anticipated that the [[User, Behaviour|user behaviour]] would shift from desktop to mobile. At this point in time, Facebook is still mainly focusing on the desktop business, so this isn't great news for them. There are two main problems for Facebook:[^1]

- it is unclear how the user behaviour on mobile devices will look like
- the amount of screen space is massively reduced (less space for [[Advertisement|ads]])

Realising that the revenue in [[Marketing, Online|online marketing]] will shift from desktop to [[Marketing, Mobile|mobile]], Facebook needed to quickly shift their core business strategy too. To achieve this, they had the classic choice: [[Make or Buy]]. WhatsApp at this point is the quick entry ticket to the biggest online communication network.[^1]
