# Java Method Body

The method body is where all the action of a method takes place; the method body contains all the legal Java instructions that implement the method. Within the method body, you can use the [[Java Keywords, This|this keyword]] to refer to the current object. The current object is the object whose method is being [[Brain/Java, Calling a Method|called]]. In addition, you can declare [[Java, Local Variable|exclusive variables]], that can only be used within the method.[^1]
