# Data Types, List

In computer science, a list is an [[Data Type, Abstract|abstract data type]] used for storing sequential items. It represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.[^1] It's more common to use arrays, queues, and stacks for similar tasks in [[Imperative Programming|imperative languages]].[^2]
