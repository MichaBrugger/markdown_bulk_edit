In short: Probably not. However, there are [[How to minimise the Risk to Fail because of the Innovator's Dilemma|a few things a company can do]] to at least minimise the risk (this should always be seen in the context of [[VUCA]], especially [[Uncertainty]]).

All successful established companies will sooner or later face the [[Innovator's Dilemma|innovator's dilemma]]. Specifically, as companies focus on [[Innovation, Exploitative|improving their products and services]] for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) [[Customer|customers]], they exceed the needs of some customer segments and ignore the needs of others.

New entrants (for example [[Start-Up|start-ups]] can then successfully [[Customer, Targeting|target]] those overlooked segments, [[Difference between SAP and Salesforce|gaining foothold by delivering more suitable functionality]] (often at [[Price, Low|lower prices]]). The currently dominant companies tend to not respond vigorously, since they are chasing after the more demanding and profitable customers and it's impossible to cover everything.

Entrants then move upmarket, delivering the value that the incumbents [[Culture, Mainstream|mainstream]] customers require, while preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When [[Customer, Mainstream|mainstream customers]] start adopting the entrants offerings in volume, [[Market, Disruption|disruption]] has occurred. By finding the application use and [[Market|market]], the new entrants advance rapidly and hit the steep part of the class [[S-Curve]], eventually entering the more [[Market, Mature|mature markets]] of the incumbents and disrupting them.

# Notes

This is a classic case of [[Pick your Battlefield]]. There is no way that the incumbent can cover every possible option that could occur. The question is, if there is a point where players can be [[Too Big to Fail]]?
