# Connection Between Atomic Notes and the Single Responsibility Principle

```ad-essence
- Keep both my code and my notes simple and small.
- Call things what they are and be explicit. There are no bonus points for the most spartanic file-names.
- Be aware of this overlap and use it to connect the two areas.
```

I was discussing my new [[Obsidian, Structure|Obsidian Structure]] with [[Brugger, Barbara|Mom]] and while doing that, I realised that both the concept of [[Atomic Notes|atomic notes]] and the [[Single Responsibility Principle]] (SRP) evolve, in essence, around the same thought. At the core of both there is the smallest unit, an element that is both flexible enough to be used in or allocated to multiple different environments and simple enough to be easily understood (even out of context).

In addition, [[Martin, Robert C.|Robert C. Martin]], who coined the term SRP, makes the correct, explicit and specific naming of variables and methods a core topic in his book [[Clean Code (Robert C. Martin)]]. With my tendency towards minimalistic file-names, this is something I should definitely keep in mind for my [[Knowledge Management, Personal|PKM system]].

All in all, I think this is a fascinating connection. Even though it‚Äôs somewhat obvious, I haven‚Äôt made it so far, and I‚Äôm happy I did now. Keeping things simple, clean, and calling them what they are seems generally like a good life philosophy, and being aware of this connection should allow me to better transfer learning from one area to the other and thus make more progress in either of them.

When I then discussed this point up with [[Gruener, Marc|Marc]] we came to the conclusion that this goes even further: Writing a note is like writing an [[Object Oriented Programming|OOP]] program. I start with a class, and they slowly split off methods, other classes, etc. In essence, it's basically like the development of a cell in the body. Once ‚Äútoo much‚Äù information is there, the cell can split and the two remaining parts can be autonomous, yet connected organisms again.
