# Class Loader in Java

A Java program typically consists of several pieces called [[Java, Class|classes]]. Each class may have a separate author and each is compiled (translated into [[Byte#Byte-Code|byte-code]]) separately. A class loader (called a linker in other [[Programming Language|programming languages]]) automatically connects the classes together. Java classes in the standard Java library are accessed using the Java Applications Programming Interface, commonly referred to as the Java API.[^1]

A [[Java, Source Code|source code]] file contains one or more Java classes. But if there is more than one, only one may be [[Java Keywords, Public|public]].[^2]
