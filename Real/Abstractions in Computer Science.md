# Abstractions in Computer Science

[[Abstraction, layers|Multi-layer abstractions]] are everywhere in [[Computer Science]]. When a company like Intel or AMD designs the computer chip powering a computer or phone, that company also publishes an abstraction layer â€“ a set of commands for controlling the chip. These commands are called [[Assembler|assembly]] instructions or [[Machine Language|machine]] instructions, and they are an extremely detailed way of writing programs that the chip itself understands.

In many languages, such as [[Python]], programs are run using a process called [[Interpreter|interpretation]]. In this process, the Python program acts as an interpreter that takes the Python code you write and figures out the appropriate machine instructions for that code.[^1]
