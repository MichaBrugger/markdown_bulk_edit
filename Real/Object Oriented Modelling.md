# Object Oriented Modelling

OOM is an approach to modelling an application when starting a [[Software Development]] project.
This is typically done at the beginning of the [[Software Development, Life Cycle|software development life cycle]]. The main reason for modelling are:

- [[Communication]]: Users typically [[Language, Barrier|cannot understand programming language]] or code. Model diagrams can be more understandable and can allow users to give developers [[Feedback|feedback]] on the appropriate structure of the system.
- [[Abstraction]]: A goal of most software methodologies is to first address 'what'questions and then address 'how' questions.

Object oriented modelling is typically done using use cases and abstract definitions of the most important objects.
