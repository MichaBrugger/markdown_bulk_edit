# Ecosystem, Business

All the relevant players in the [[Value, Creation|value creation]] process ([[Customer|customers]], partners, competitors), the relationships between them and influencing forces such as technologies, trends and regulatory changes. A [[Corporation|company]] is both affected by its ecosystem and actively affects it.[^1]

An [[Economy|economic]] community supported by a foundation of interacting organisations and individuals – the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they co-evolve their [[Capability|capabilities]] and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to align their [[Investment|investments]], and to find mutually supportive roles.[^2]
