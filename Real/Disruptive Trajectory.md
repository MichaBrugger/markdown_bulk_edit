# Disruptive Trajectory

Part of the [[The Disruptive Innovation Model|disruptive innovation model]].[^1]

1. [[Market, Disruption|Disruption]] is a [[Process|process]]
    1. It's not a fixed point at which disruption happens, but more an evolution of a product over time.
    2. Disrupters tend to get the [[Business Model|business model]] just right, before the product.
    3. The fact that disruption takes time also helps to explain, why incumbents often overlook disruptors. (Netflix example)
2. Disrupters often build business models that are very different from those of incumbents.
    1. Apple - Smartphones contested Laptops as the primary way to access the internet.
3. Some [[Innovation, Disruptive|disruptive innovations]] succeed; some don't.
    1. Success is not built into the definition of disruption. (Example of internet providers, who were all on a disruptive trajectory).
4. The mantra of "Disrupt or be disrupted" can misguide us.
    1. Existing companies do need to react to disruption, but not need to overreact by dismantling a still profitable business, instead, they should try to strengthen core [[Customer, Relationship|customer relations]] by investing into [[Innovation, Incremental|sustaining innovation]]. Then they need to build a new department and <mark style="background: #496417AD;">manage two different operations</mark> in the meantime, since those are often much more successful.
    2. Only 6 % of sustaining entrants succeed, when they face the existing competition head on.

## Notes

- How does the misguidance through "Disrupt or be disrupted" go against [[Steve Jobs on Business Innovation|Steve Jobs' quote]]? #ðŸŽ±
- How does "managing two different operations" connect to [[Ambidexterity, Organisational]]? #ðŸŒ± this is [[Strategic Intent]]
- not need to overreact --> shape the future, reserve the spot  (levels of uncertainty - strat under uncertainty)
