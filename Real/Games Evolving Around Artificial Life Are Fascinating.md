# Games Evolving Around Artificial Life Are Fascinating

I’ve been watching quite a few videos about games evolving around the topic of [[Artificial Life]] in video games. I would love to be able to build something like this one day. There are multiple examples that I really like. One evolves around the Bibits,[^3] which look extremely simple, but they have quite complex needs that the creator keeps evolving. The other one is more visually pleasing and is called [[The Sapling]]. It’s a bit less complex, but basically allows for the simulation of a complete ecosystem. I actually saw it runs on Linux, so I’ll probably give it a go today.[^4]
