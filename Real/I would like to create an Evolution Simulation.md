# I Would Like to Create an Evolution Simulation

This has been on my mind for a while now. Especially after videos like [[davidrandallmiller2020ProgrammedCreaturesTheyEvolved|this.]] I'm getting super excited. I'm also trying to, for the first time, document my ‚Äújourney‚Äù the way I would like to do it now in Obsidian.

- [[20211209-0839-CodingChallenge85Game|Coding Challenge 85 - The Game of Life]]

Good video, but I only watched the first 12 minutes. The [[The Game of Life]] is definitely very interesting, but I'd rather go towards something a bit more ‚Äúintelligent" (probably including [[Neural Network]]).

Interesting video that has some good ideas for a project, but it isn't really specific enough for me to follow it properly.

Even though I thought after the first video I'd go away from the Cellular automata, I think it's probably a good way to start. Unfortunately, the whole example is written in Pseudo-Code. And the source code he provides is written in a language called [[Defold]] that I've never heard of. The video was still very fascinating, and the steps are certainly going to be useful.

I'm not 100% sure where to go after this one. I found [[20211210-1549-ProceduralCaveGenerationE01|this video by Sebastian Lague]] but I think I should stop with the theory and write some code.

The video is a repetition. I think it might be interesting to follow his Nature of Code Series, but for today I'm going to stop and find something I can follow along with code.

I finally found something. I started up a new project. Let's see how it goes.

The steps explained to create a genetic algorithm are largely similar to [[20211209-1107-GeneticAlgorithmScratchPython|this video]].

I started looking into 2D game creation in order to create a canvas for my [[Evolution, Simulation|evolution sim]] but then I had an awesome idea: I'm going to wrap my [[AEKI Smart Manufacturing]] factory in a 2D game wrapper. Like a little [[Pok√©mon]] version of a factory.
