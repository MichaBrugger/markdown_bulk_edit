# Principle of Confrontation

In line with the confrontation principle, new business models are examined by intentionally confronting extreme options. In this process, a [[Corporation|company]]â€™s current business model is set against business model scenarios found in unrelated [[Industry|industries]].[^1]

The principle of confrontation in the context of the Business Model Navigator is one of two principles applied in the [[Business Model Navigator, Ideation|Ideation]] stage. Its goal is to create business model innovation ideas by confronting your business model with patterns that are unrelated to your business model.
