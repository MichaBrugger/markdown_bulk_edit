# Data Type, Array

The array is a basic [[Data Type, Abstract|abstract data type]] (ADT) that holds an ordered collection of items accessible by an [[Data Type, Integer|integer]] index. These items can be anything from [[Data Type, Primitive|primitive types]] such as integers to more complex types like instances of classes. Since it's an ADT, it doesn't specify an implementation, but is almost always implemented by an [[Data Structure, Array|array]]  or dynamic array.[^1]

Depending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other data types that describe aggregates of values, such as [[Data Type, List|lists]] and strings.[^2]
