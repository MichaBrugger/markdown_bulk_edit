# Should I Use Tags or Links for My Vault?

I'm going through this process to [[Obsidian, Structure|structure my obsidian vault]].
- Using Tags as soft links indicating the status of the file makes it easier to make them optional.
- Links are used as strong connectors between different files, this allows to connect a file to multiple topics more easily.
- MOCs are critical to manage a vault without a folder hierarchy, since else there is no way the notes are accessible anymore once it reaches a critical mass.
- MOCs make it easier to see the overview of your system. Allowing the user to define the structure on the go, rather than defining all the levels and logical structure as an upfront task.

## Links

- Links are bidirectional, make a web, and there can be multiple links per note.
- You can see the interaction between different things.
- Since links connect ideas and provide navigation, they are generally the way to go.

### Tags

- No central note, the tag itself is the center.
- Tags are great when you want to avoid having some sort of hub (f.e. ‘#123Meeting).
- There is the option for nesting. This nesting also makes them great for displayed the status and character of a note.

### Folders

- A note can only be in one folder at a time.
