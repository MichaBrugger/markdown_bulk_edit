# Sequence Diagram

Shows the relationship between object (including messages) in the context of time.
- The vertical line shows how long an object exists.
- Messages are shown as horizontal arrows between the 'life-lines' of the objects (optionally including parameters and potential restrictions)
- Restrictions can be: necessity of previous steps, iterations
- Returns are drawn using an 'open-arrow' and show when the 'control' comes back to the sender of the message.
