# Java, Queue Interface

The Java Queue interface represents a data structure designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed from the beginning of the queue ([[First-in-First-out|FIFO]]).

The Java Queue interface is a subtype of the [[Java, Collection Framework|Java collection]] interface. It represents an ordered sequence of objects just like a Java List, but its intended use is slightly different. Because the Java Queue interface is a subtype of the Java Collection interface, all methods in the Collection interface are also available in the Queue interface.[^1]
