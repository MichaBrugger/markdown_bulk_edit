# Difference Between Customer and User

Traditionally, the [[Customer]] and the [[User]] of a [[Product|product]] or [[Service|service]] are the same. But with the emergence of new business models, it happens more and more, that they are two different people. The customer is the one actually paying for the product, while the user is the one to use it.[^1] [^2]

A great example for this is the [[Difference between SAP and Salesforce|comparison between SAP and Salesforce]].
