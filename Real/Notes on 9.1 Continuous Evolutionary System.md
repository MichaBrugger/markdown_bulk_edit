# Notes on Continuous Evolutionary System

He brings up the point that many [[Ecosystem, Simulation|ecosystem simulations]] are discontinuous in nature. Meaning that you have a population, it lives and at the end of their “window” they all die together, and a new generation is born. This means that they are, in this sense, not very realistic.

He shows a rather simple system that converges towards “medium” (size and speed).

When there is no fitness function, it's actually down to [[Survival of the Survivors]] (vs. [[Survival of the Fittest]]). This means that a single “being” doesn't increase its chances of reproduction by having good attributes, but rather by just trying to live as long as possible.
