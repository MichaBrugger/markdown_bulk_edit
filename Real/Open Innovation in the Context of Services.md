# Innovation in the Context of Services

[[Innovation|Innovation]] must negotiate a tension between [[Standardisation|standardisation]] and [[Customisation|customisation]]. Standardisation allows activities to be repeated many times with great efficiency, <mark style="background: #496417AD;">spreading the [[Cost, Fixed|fixed costs]]</mark> of those activities over many transactions. Customisation allows each customer to get what he or she wants, for <mark style="background: #496417AD;">high personal satisfaction</mark> . The problem is that standardisation denies customers much of what they want, while customisation undermines the efficiencies available from standardisation.

The resolution to this dichotomy is to construct [[Platform as a Service|service platforms]]. These platforms invite others [[Open Innovation|to build on top of your own offering]] (the platform), allowing for economies emerging from the standardisation of the platform along with customisation created by the additions of many others to the platform.

## Notes

- Connect this to [[Business Model, Mass Customization|mass customisation]], [[Industry 4.0, Effect]]
- Classic [[Stuck in the Middle]] approach. #♻️
