# User Design

Within user manufacturing, a customer is both the [[Manufacturer|manufacturer]] and the [[Consumer|consumer]]. As an example, an [[Platform|online platform]] provides the customer with the necessary [[Customer, Support|support]] in order to design and merchandise the product, e.g., [[Software, Product Design|product design software]], manufacturing services, or an online shop to sell the product. The [[Customer, Gains|customer benefits]] from the potential to realise [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneurial]] ideas without having to provide the required [[Infrastructure|infrastructure]]. [[Revenue, Generation|Revenue is then generated]] as part of the actual [[Sales|sales]].[^1]

## Notes
