# Compiler

A compiler translates computer code written in one [[Programming Language|programming language]] (the source language) into another language (the target language). It's mainly used for programs that translate [[Source Code|source code]] from a high-level language to a lower level language (like [[Machine Language]] or [[Assembler]]) to create an executable program. [^1]

Most [[Programming Language#High Level Programming Languages|high-level languages]] need a different compiler for each type of computer and for each operating system.[^2]
