# External Focus, or User is King

The second dimension of [[Digitization, Dimensions|digitization]] can be described as ‚Äú[[User is King|the user is king]] and usage is the currency‚Äù. This means that, this approach [[Connection between User is King and Business Model|focuses on value generation for the users and not on direct gains for the company]].

Software is, right from the start, is built with the idea of [[Value, Creation|generating value]] [[User Centricity|for the user]] in mind.  This, in short, is a description of the [[Internet, B2C|B2C internet]] business model that especially American and Chinese companies are currently great at (Software with great [[User, Experience|UX]]).[^1]

A great example for how this is relevant is the [[Difference between SAP and Salesforce|comparison between SAP and Salesforce]].

To make a [[Business Case|business case]] in this regard, we have to see the long-term value that can be generated (and later monetised) by creating customer value. However, we need to understand that the [[Value Chain|value chain]] for projects like this can be very long and complex.
