# Difference Between Requirements Engineering and Management

[[Requirements Engineering]]:
- The systematic, well-disciplined and quantifiable procedure of specifying, i.e. capturing, describing and [[Testing]] requirements for software
- Understanding and describing what [[customers]] want or need
- In addition to the procedure, quality characteristics are also defined that each individual requirement, but also the entire requirements document, must fulfil
- Incorporates linearly into the development process, in the analysis phase and the test phase

[[Requirements Management]]:
- Defined procedure that makes it possible to systematically deal with the often unmanageable number of requirements and requirement changes
- Has an accompanying effect beyond the analysis phase
