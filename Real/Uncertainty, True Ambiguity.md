# Uncertainty, True Ambiguity

[[Ambiguity|At level 4]] multiple dimensions of [[Uncertainty|uncertainty]] interact to create an environment that is virtually impossible to predict. Unlike in level 3 situations, the range of potential outcomes cannot be identified, let alone scenarios within that range. It might not even be possible to identify, much less predict, all the relevant variables that will define the future.

[[Manager|Managers]] need to catalogue systematically what they know and what is possible to know. Even if it is impossible to develop a meaningful set of probable, or even possible, outcomes in level 4 situations, managers can gain valuable strategic perspective.

Finally, although it will be impossible to quantify the risks and returns of different strategies, managers should be able to identify what information they would have to believe about the future to justify the investments they are considering.[^1]

Recall that level 4 situations are transitional by nature, often occurring after a major technological, macroeconomic, or legislative shock. Since no player necessarily knows the best strategy in these environments, the [[Strategic Posture, Shape the Future|shaper]]â€™s role is to provide a [[Vision|vision]] of an [[Industry, Structure|industry structure]] and [[Standard|standards]] that will coordinate the strategies of other players and drive the [[Market]] toward a more stable and favorable outcome.
