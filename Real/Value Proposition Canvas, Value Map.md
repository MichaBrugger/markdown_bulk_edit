# VPC â€“ Value Map

The customer profile is the second part of the [[Value Proposition Canvas]]. It's used to list the products and services the companies value proposition builds on. It describes in which way the products and features offered are pain relievers, and in which way they create gains for the customers.[^1]

Great value propositions target essential customer jobs, pains, and gains and do so extremely well. A [[Customer Profile|customer profile]] may contain countless jobs, pains, and gains, but the value map highlights which ones you intend to focus on.[^1]
