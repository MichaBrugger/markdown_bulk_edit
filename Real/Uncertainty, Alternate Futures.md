# Uncertainty, Alternate Futures

At level 2, the future can be described as one of a few alternate outcomes, or discrete [[Scenario|scenarios]]. Analysis cannot identify which outcome will occur, although it may help establish probabilities. Most important, some, if not all, elements of the strategy would change if the outcome were predictable.

Level 2 situations are a bit more [[Complexity|complex]]. First, managers must develop a set of discrete scenarios based on their understanding of how the key [[Uncertainty, residual|residual uncertainties]] might play out, for example, whether deregulation occurs or not, a competitor builds a new plant or not. Each scenario may require a different valuation model. After establishing an appropriate valuation model for each possible outcome and determining how probable each is likely to be, a classic decision-analysis framework can be used to evaluate the risks and returns inherent in alternative strategies

In level 2 situations, it is important not only to identify the different possible future outcomes but also to think through the likely paths the industry might take to reach those alternative futures.[^1]

If [[Strategic Posture, Shape the Future|shapers]] in level 1 try to raise [[Uncertainty|uncertainty]], in levels 2 through 4 they try to lower uncertainty and create order out of chaos. In level 2, a shaping strategy is designed to increase the probability that a favoured industry scenario will occur.
