# Memory

Memory consists of two types of storage:

- [[Memory, Main|main memory]] (volatile)
- [[Memory, Auxiliary|auxiliary memory]] (non-volatile)

## Storing Data in Memory

Data of all kinds (numbers, letters, strings of characters, audio, video, even programs) are encoded and stored using [[Binary Numbers|1s and 0s]]. When more than a single [[Byte|byte]] is needed, several adjacent bytes are used. The [[Memory, Address|address]] of the first byte is the address of the unit of bytes.
