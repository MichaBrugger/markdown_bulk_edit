# Data Type, Abstract

Abstract data types are a way of classifying [[Data Structure, Array|data structures]] based on how they are used and the behaviours they provide. They do not specify how the data structure must be implemented or laid out in [[Memory|memory]], but simply provide a minimal expected interface and set of behaviours.[^1]
