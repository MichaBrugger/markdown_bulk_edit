# Algorithm, Analysis

In computer science, the analysis of [[Algorithm|algorithms]] is the process of finding the computational [[Complexity|complexity]] of algorithms â€“ the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the [[Time Complexity|number of steps it takes]]or the [[Space Complexity|number of storage locations]] it uses. [^1]

In [[Computer Science|computer science]] we generally use [[Big O Notation]] in order to classify algorithms according to how their runtime or space requirements grow as the input size grows. [^2]
