# Software Requirements Specification

A SRS is a description, how a [[Software, System|software system]] should be developed. It generally lays out the [[Requirements, Functional|functional]] and [[Requirements, Non-Functional|non-functional]] requirements and may include a set of [[Software, Use-Case|use-cases]] that describe the user interactions.

A good SRS should be:[^1]
- Adequate: describing what the [[Customer|customer]] wants or needs
- Complete: describing everything the [[Customer, Gains|customer wants or needs]]
- Consistent: otherwise the [[Requirements Specification|specification]] can't be realised
- Comprehensive: for the customer and for the computer scientists
- Unambiguous: so that errors due to misinterpretation are avoided
- Verifiable: being able to determine whether the realised system meets the [[Requirements|requirements]]
