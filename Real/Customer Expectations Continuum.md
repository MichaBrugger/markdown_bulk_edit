# Customer Expectations Continuum

For every [[Customer, Jobs|job-to-be-done]] the [[Customer Expectations|expectations of a customer]] can be seen as being situated in a continuum that goes from [[Customer, Gains|gains]] over a neutral state where the expectations are just met, into [[Customer, Pains|pains]].

In order to enable myself to go beyond thinking of them as opposites I could:[^1]

- Define a general expectations bar for the job at hand, because not meeting that is definitely a pain for the customer.
- Check for continuums that pains and gains could 'live' on
- Clarify the boundaries of those continuums

## Notes

This is not an 'official' thing. It's solely based on that article and my thoughts I had based on that. The neutral part could also be put into the perspective of [[Habit|habits]]. #ðŸŒ±
