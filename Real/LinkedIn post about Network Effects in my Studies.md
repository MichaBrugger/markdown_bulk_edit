# LinkedIn Post About [[Network Effect|Network Effects]] in My Studies

I could make a [[LinkedIn]] post about how I studied the effects of [[Business Innovation 2|networks in business]] with a [[Obsidian|network graphing tool]]. I could then also say how these things tie into my general interest in [[Neuroscience]], [[Machine Learning]] and [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]].

This is a very interesting connection and probably also would look pretty interesting to others.

- I should Zoom out from Business Innovation.
