# Ambidexterity, Architectural

Architectural [[Ambidexterity|ambidexterity]] theories focus on dual structures and strategies to enable differentiation between [[Innovation, Exploitative|exploitative]] and [[Innovation, Explorative|explorative]] innovation. That implies concentrating on each aspect individually, and only later [[Integration|integrating]] them. These dual strategies utilise spatial or temporal tactics to ensure separation.[^1]
