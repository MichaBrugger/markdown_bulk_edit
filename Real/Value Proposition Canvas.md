# Value Proposition Canvas

The VPCÂ can be used to create products and services, that customers want (it addresses the [[User Journey, Gap Analysis|value gaps]] in the [[User Journey|user journey cycle]][^1]). It's a form of [[Value Proposition Design]] and consists of two parts: the [[Customer Profile|customer profile]] and the [[Value Proposition Canvas, Value Map|value map]].[^2]

A fit is achieved by creating a clear connection between what matters to the customers and how the products and services offered ease [[Customer, Pains|pains]] and create [[Customer, Gains|gains]]. However, no matter how good the fit, it's important to understand that good value propositions always need to be integrated into scalable and profitable business models.[^3]
