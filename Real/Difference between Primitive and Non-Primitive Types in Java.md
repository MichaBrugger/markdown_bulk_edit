# Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Types in Java

- [[Java, Primitive Types|Primitive types]] are predefined in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for `String`).
- [[Java, Non-Primitive Types|Non-primitive types]] can be used to call [[Java, Method|methods]] to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
- A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be [[Java Keywords, Null|null]].
- A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter ([[Java, Naming Conventions|naming conventions]]).
- The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
