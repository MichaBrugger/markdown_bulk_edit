# Computer Science, Time Complexity

In [[Computer Science|computer science]], the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an [[Algorithm|algorithm]]. It is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factor.[^1]
