# Are Customer Gains the Opposite of Customer Pains

Short answer: not really.

If the positive or negative result falls under the normal expectations of the [[Customer|customer]] then [[Customer, Gains|gains]] aren't really the opposite of [[Customer, Pains|pains]].[^1] Pains and gains in this sense can be seen as a sort of non-binary [[Customer Expectations Continuum|continuum]]. Basically anything the customer perceives can be seen on this scale from gain over neutral to pain, or the other way around.
