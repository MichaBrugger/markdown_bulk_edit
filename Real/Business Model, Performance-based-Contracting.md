# Performance-based-Contracting

A productâ€™s [[Price|price]] is not based upon its physical [[Value|value]], but on the [[Performance|performance]] or [[Customer, Gains|valuable outcome]] it delivers, in the form of a [[Service|service]]. Special expertise and [[Economies of Scale|economies of scale]] result in lower [[Cost, Production|production]] and [[Cost, Maintenance|maintenance]] [[Cost, Reduction|costs]] of a [[Product|product]], which can be forwarded to the [[Customer|customer]]. Extreme variants of this model are represented by different operation schemes in which the product remains the property of, and is operated by, the company.[^2]

## Notes

There is a weird similarity to the [[Business Model, Fractional Ownership|fractional ownership model]] here.
