# User Centricity

User (or [[Customer|customer]]) centricity describes a product (or its development process) that puts the [[User|user's]] wishes in the centre. It is strongly related to the [[User is King]] concept. In short, by creating customer value and really putting customers first, beyond a simple customer focus, companies hope to generate long-lasting business value.[^1]

In practice, the company has to understand the [[User, Behaviour|user behaviour]] in order to know how they can generate [[User, Value|value for those users]]. For this, they can use tools like [[Design Thinking]] and [[Lean Start-Up]] and other [[Business Innovation|business innovation]] approaches.[^2]
