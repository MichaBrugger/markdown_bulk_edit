# Connection Between Direct Selling, Experience Selling and Lock-In

Based on the business model pattern analysis in the [[Business Model Navigator]], there seems to be a connection between [[Business Model, Direct Selling|direct selling]], [[Business Model, Experience Selling|experience selling]] and the application of [[Business Model, Lock-In|Lock-In]] mechanisms. I realised the connection especially through the case of [[NestlÃ©]], who applied in with multiple products.

I would have to research more, but I do think that there is most likely a deeper connection here.
