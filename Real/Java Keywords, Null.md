# Java Keywords, Null

In Java, null is a reserved word (keyword) for literal values. It seems like a keyword, but actually, it is a literal similar to true and false. The word null is case sensitive and we cannot write null as Null or NULL.

All object-variables are initialised as `null`. It can be assigned and tested.
