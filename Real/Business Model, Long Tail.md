# Business Model, Long Tail

Instead of concentrating on [[Business Model, Blockbuster|blockbusters]], the main bulk of [[Revenue, Generation|revenues is generated]] through a Long Tail of [[Product, Niche|niche products]]. Individually, these neither demand high volumes, nor allow for a high [[Margin, Low|margin]]. If a vast variety of these [[Product|products]] are offered in sufficient amounts, the small-scale profits can add up to a significant amount.[^1]

## Notes

There is most definitely a connection between [[Economies of Scale]] and Long Tail models.
