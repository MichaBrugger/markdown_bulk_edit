# Java Variable Assignment

In order to store a value in a [[Java, Variable|variable]], an assignment statement must be used.[^1] Assigning a value to a variable in Java follows this pattern:[^2]

```java
variableName = value;
```

The [[Java, Assignment Operator|assignment operator]] is the equal (=) sign.[^3] The operand on the left side of the assignment operator must be a variable name. The operand on the right side must be either a [[Literals (Java)|literal]] or expression that evaluates to a type that is compatible with the type of the variable.[^1]
