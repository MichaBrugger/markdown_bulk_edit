# Innovation, Disruptive

A disruptive innovation is a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources challenges an established incumbent.

A radical innovation that makes an existing technology, product or service obsolete.

Disruptive Innovation generally starts from one of two footholds:

- [[Foothold, Low-End / [[Customer Expectations
- [[Foothold, New Market / [[Blue Ocean

## Notes

The 'overshooting' approach has once again a strong relation to the whole [[Customer Expectations idea. The value created is outside of the customers expectation thresholds and thus doesn't add any value anymore. #ðŸŒ±
