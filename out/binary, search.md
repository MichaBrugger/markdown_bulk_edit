# Binary, Search

sorted collection for a target. It works by comparing the target to the middle element in a collection. If the target is greater than the middle element, the left elements are discarded. If the target is less than the middle element, the right elements are discarded. This process is repeated until the middle element is equal to the target, and if no further splitting can be done. The target does not exist in the list.[^1]
