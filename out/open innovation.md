# Open Innovation

"I do believe that one of the fundamental philosophical underpinnings of open innovation is the idea of abundance." - Henry Chesbrough

In a nutshell, the idea of Open Innovation is that organisations should, on one hand, make greater use of external ideas and technologies in their own innovation activities and, on the other hand, allow much of their own unused ideas and technologies to go outside.[^1]

It's important to see that Open Innovation doesn't just mean, that the company is open to anyone, but that the company chooses partners, customers (universities or public institutions with whom they want to work together.[^2]

Open innovation implies that companies should be both active sellers of IP (when it does not fit their own business model) and active buyers of IP (when external IP does fit their business model).
