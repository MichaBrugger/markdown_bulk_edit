# Java, Field Declaration

A non-static or static field is generally declared using the following syntax:[^1]

```java
// The square brackets [ ] around some of the keywords mean that this option is optional. Only type and name are required.

[access_modifier] [static] [final] type name [= initial value] ;
```

- First, an access modifier can be declared for a Java field. The access modifier determines which object classes that can access the Java field.
- Second, a data type for the field must be assigned.
- Third, the field can be declared.
