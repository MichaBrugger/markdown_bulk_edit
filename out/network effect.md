# Network Effect

It has been established that the value of a network increases as the number of users within it increases. With this value, it becomes more attractive and the number of users grows exponentially.[^1]

The value of a product or service for a user depends on the amount of users in the network using it. A positive network effect means that an increased distribution has benefits for both sides, the producer and the user: The more users, the more valuable the marketplace.[^2]

There are two types of positive network effects:

- [[Network Effect, Consumption
- [[Network Effect, Production
- [[Network Effect, Direct
- [[Network Effect, Indirect
