I could split everything according to the logic:

- Something you do = Process/Methodology
- Concept
- A real thing = Entity (Company, People, etc.)
- A goal (Cost leadership strategy)

- it's for example important that I differentiate between the strategy (cost leadership) and the method (f.e. cost reduction, low cost, etc.)

- I could have a type connector note and a type entity note

- big topics can be connected to many things that they somehow relate to, but files like "difference between, etc." should always only link to the direct things that make them relate else topics with many files have more "weight"

How do I classify something like obsidian?

I could also go for something like:

- Method
- Framework
- Object
- Class
- Methodology -> How to do something
- Goals -> Something to be achieved through Methodology
- Entity -> People, Companies, etc
- Skills
- Process

- Concepts
- Principle
- Pattern
- Representations
