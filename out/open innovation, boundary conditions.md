# Open Innovation, Boundary Conditions

To move beyond simply celebrating successes, we must consider some underlying conditions that need to be satisfied for [[Open Innovation to be successful.

One would be workforce mobility. To move knowledge, you need to move people. To take full advantage of the inside-out branch of open innovation, one or more people often need to move with the project for some extended period of time to transplant the project effectively in the new firm.

Another boundary condition is the presence of internal [[Connection between Open Innovation and R&D. Some consider open innovation to be a rationale for outsourcing R&D. But this misunderstands the nature of innovation. To transfer knowledge effectively so that companies can really make use of it, you need a certain amount of creative abrasion and a certain amount of time together working on the problem.

A truly successful open innovation effort also requires people who operate in a boundary-spanning role, who can connect knowledge from different sources and find ways to mash it all together in new combinations. Such people are sometimes called “T-shaped managers”.

Yet another condition is the need for some basic IP rules to enable open innovation, particularly in situations where capital-intensive investments have to be made.

And that is where we’re going. Open innovation’s effectiveness is not restricted to a few select corporations. It is a process that makes more effective use of internal and external knowledge in every organisation.[^1]
