# Business Model, Fractional Ownership

Fractional Ownership describes the sharing of a certain asset class among a group of owners. Typically, the asset is rather capital intensive but only needed on an occasional basis. While the customer does benefit from the rights he has as an owner, he does not have to provide the entire capital alone.[^1]
