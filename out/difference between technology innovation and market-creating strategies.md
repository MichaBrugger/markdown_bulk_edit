# Difference Between Technology Innovation and Market-Creating Strategies

R&D and technology innovation are widely recognised as key drivers of market development and industry growth. It's understandable, therefore, that managers might assume that they are also key drivers in the discovery of new markets. But the reality is that market creation is not inevitably about technological innovation.  

Value innovation, not technology innovation, is what launches commercially compelling new markets. Successful new products or services open market spaces by offering a leap in productivity, simplicity, ease of use, convenience, fun, or environmental friendliness. But when companies mistakenly assume that market creation hinges on breakthrough technologies, their organisations tend to push for products or services that are too "out there," too complicated, or, like the Segway, lacking a necessary ecosystem.[^1]
