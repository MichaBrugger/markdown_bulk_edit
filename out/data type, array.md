# Data Type, Array

The array is a basic abstract data type (ADT) that holds an ordered collection of items accessible by an integer index. These items can be anything from primitive types such as integers to more complex types like instances of classes. Since it's an ADT, it doesn't specify an implementation, but is almost always implemented by an array  or dynamic array.[^1]

Depending on the language, array types may overlap (or be identified with) other data types that describe aggregates of values, such as lists and strings.[^2]
