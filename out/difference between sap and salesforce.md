# Difference Between SAP and Salesforce

along the first axis of digitization. SAP is extremely complex, but still manages to be excellent regarding performance.

And here lies the core difference between SAP and user centricity in mind, it was built and optimised for companies. So, even though Salesforce is the technically worse solution and arguably less useful for the company as an entity, it is generally favoured by its actual users and thus gets bought more. This can be seen directly in the companies' growth numbers: Salesforce is 3x bigger than SAP and grows 3x faster, too. This is a great example for the [[User is King logic.[^1]

## Notes

An interesting thought here: This is a very similar phenomenon like the discussion in computer science around code that is optimised to be read by a computer vs. computer that is meant to be read by a human. This is also discussed by |Donald Knuth and Lex Fridman in their podcast. Knuth then references the concept of literate programming, which proposes to write code as a mix between traditional language and traditional source Code.
