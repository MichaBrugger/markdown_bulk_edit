# Business Model, Integrator

An Integrator is in command of the bulk of steps in the value-adding process. The control of all resources and capabilities in terms of value creation lies with the company. Efficiency gains, economies of scope and low dependencies from suppliers result in a decrease of costs and can increase the stability of the value creation.[^2]

## Notes

An example for an integrator would be Fords Model T, so there might also be a connection to the [[Blue Ocean Strategy here.
