# External Focus, or User is King

The second dimension of digitization can be described as “the user is king and usage is the currency”. This means that, this approach focuses on value generation for the users and not on direct gains for the company.

Software is, right from the start, is built with the idea of generating value for the user in mind.  This, in short, is a description of the B2C internet business model that especially American and Chinese companies are currently great at (Software with great UX).[^1]

A great example for how this is relevant is the comparison between SAP and Salesforce.

To make a business case in this regard, we have to see the long-term value that can be generated (and later monetised) by creating customer value. However, we need to understand that the value chain for projects like this can be very long and complex.
