# Java, Serializable Interface

Serialization is the conversion of the state of an object into a byte stream; deserialization does the opposite. Classes that are eligible for serialization need to implement a special marker interface, Serializable.[^1]

Important: [[Java Keywords, Static fields belong to a class (and not the object), so they are not going to be serialized.
