# Innovation in the Context of Services

Innovation must negotiate a tension between standardisation and customisation. Standardisation allows activities to be repeated many times with great efficiency, <mark style="background: #496417AD;">spreading the fixed costs</mark> of those activities over many transactions. Customisation allows each customer to get what he or she wants, for <mark style="background: #496417AD;">high personal satisfaction</mark> . The problem is that standardisation denies customers much of what they want, while customisation undermines the efficiencies available from standardisation.

The resolution to this dichotomy is to construct service platforms. These platforms invite others to build on top of your own offering (the platform), allowing for economies emerging from the standardisation of the platform along with customisation created by the additions of many others to the platform.
