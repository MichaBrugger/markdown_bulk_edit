# Memory

Memory consists of two types of storage:

- main memory (volatile)
- auxiliary memory (non-volatile)

## Storing Data in Memory

Data of all kinds (numbers, letters, strings of characters, audio, video, even programs) are encoded and stored using 1s and 0s. When more than a single byte is needed, several adjacent bytes are used. The address of the first byte is the address of the unit of bytes.
