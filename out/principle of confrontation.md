# Principle of Confrontation

In line with the confrontation principle, new business models are examined by intentionally confronting extreme options. In this process, a companyâ€™s current business model is set against business model scenarios found in unrelated industries.[^1]

The principle of confrontation in the context of the Business Model Navigator is one of two principles applied in the Ideation stage. Its goal is to create business model innovation ideas by confronting your business model with patterns that are unrelated to your business model.
