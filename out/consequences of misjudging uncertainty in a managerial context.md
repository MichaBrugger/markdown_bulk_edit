# Consequences of Misjudging Uncertainty in a Managerial Context

Underestimating strategies that neither defend against the threats nor take advantage of the opportunities that higher levels of uncertainty may provide.

At the other extreme, assuming that the world is entirely unpredictable can lead managers to abandon the analytical rigour of their traditional planning processes altogether and base their strategic decisions primarily on gut instinct. This “just do it” approach to strategy can cause executives to place misinformed bets on emerging products or markets that result in record write-offs.[^1]
