# Business Model, Aikido

Aikido is a Japanese martial art in which the strength of an attacker is used against him. As a business model, Aikido allows a company to offer something diametrically opposed to the image and mind-set of the competition. This new value proposition attracts customers who prefer ideas or concepts opposed to the mainstream.[^1]
