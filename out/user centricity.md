# User Centricity

User (or customer) centricity describes a product (or its development process) that puts the user's wishes in the centre. It is strongly related to the [[User is King concept. In short, by creating customer value and really putting customers first, beyond a simple customer focus, companies hope to generate long-lasting business value.[^1]

In practice, the company has to understand the user behaviour in order to know how they can generate value for those users. For this, they can use tools like business innovation approaches.[^2]
