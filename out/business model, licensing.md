# Business Model, Licensing

Efforts are focused on developing intellectual property that can be licensed to other manufacturers. This model, therefore, does not rely on the realisation and utilisation of knowledge in the form of products, but attempts to transform these intangible goods into money. This allows a company to focus on research and development. It also allows the provision of knowledge, which would otherwise be left unused and could potentially be valuable to third parties.[^1]
