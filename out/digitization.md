# Digitisation

Digitisation is the process of creating a digital 'copy' of an analogue service, process, etc. It's a specific use-case, like making a scan of a physical receipt. And this it creates a connection between the physical and digital world.

Digitization is foundational. It's the connection between the physical world and business value because of the need for consumable data.[^1]

Not to be confused with Digitalization.
