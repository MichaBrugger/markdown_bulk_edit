A method, also known as a function, is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.[^1] Methods implement the 'behaviour' of objects. They consist of a head and a body.[^2]

When a method from within the same class is called, it's called an _internal method call_, else it's an _external method call_.[^3]
