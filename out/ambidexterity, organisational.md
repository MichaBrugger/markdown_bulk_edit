# Ambidexterity, Organisational

Organisational ambidexterity signifies the ability to excel at managing the tensions between the seemingly contrary explorative and exploitative innovation. Ambidextrous Firms are capable of simultaneous, yet contradictory, knowledge management processes, 

The arising tensions seem to be paradoxical, yet they are, in reality, synergistic and interwoven polarities. For managing these, integration and differentiation are key. Succeeding in managing ambidexterity has proven to be critical for successful product development, long-term performance and innovation as a whole.[^1]
