# Business Model, Experience Selling

The value of a product or service is increased by the customer experience offered with it. This opens the door for higher customer demand and commensurate increase in prices charged. This means that the customer experience must be adapted accordingly â€“ by attuning promotion, shop, etc.[^1]

## Notes

Adding experience to an existing product or service, can be seen as a form of service bundling.
