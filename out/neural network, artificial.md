# Neural Network, Artificial

Artificial Neural Networks were invented in order to understand and emulate the functions of the mammalian brain. Computers today can follow billions of individual instructions each second. This explosion in computing power has let scientists build ANNs that learn to identify people in images, play chess, and even help doctors make medical diagnoses.
