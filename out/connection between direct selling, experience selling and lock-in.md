# Connection Between Direct Selling, Experience Selling and Lock-In

Based on the business model pattern analysis in the direct selling, experience selling and the application of Lock-In mechanisms. I realised the connection especially through the case of [[Nestl√©, who applied in with multiple products.

I would have to research more, but I do think that there is most likely a deeper connection here.
