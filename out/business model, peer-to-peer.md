# Peer-to-Peer

This model is based on a cooperation that specialises in mediating between individuals belonging to a homogeneous group. The company offers a meeting point, i.e., an online database and communication service that connects these individuals. The company offerings could include personal objects for rent, providing certain products or services, or the sharing of information and experiences.[^2]

Seems to be connected to the [[Platform as a Service and the [[Business Model, Rent-instead-of-Buy ideas.
