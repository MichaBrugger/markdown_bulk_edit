# Stuck in the Middle

Michael Porter argued, that competitive advantage derives from one of two strategies: cost leadership or differentiation. Across most industries you can find firms and products that aim for advantage based on either cost leadership or differentiation.Â  The middle between them is not a good place to become stuck.[^1]

There are other theories that do not completely agree with this analysis.
