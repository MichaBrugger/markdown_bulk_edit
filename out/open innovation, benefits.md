[[Open Innovation, Outside-In Perspective:
Enables Crowdsourcing?). (Context: [[Research and Development) Another benefit is speed/time-savings because one can start where others left off ([[Efficiency).

[[Open Innovation, Inside-Out Perspective: By sharing ideas and technologies one can construct [[Value Chain, attracting new people from [[Ecosystem, Business. Another benefit is potentially royalties from other industries that the company could have never covered themselves anyway (maybe somewhat related to [[Business Model, Licensing or [[Business Model, Franchising). [[Research and Development is more economically sustainable.
