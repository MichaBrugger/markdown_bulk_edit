# Java, Inheritance

Inheritance is, just like classes, a form of categorisation. In Java, this hierarchy is implemented using the superclass and subclass.[^1]

Another commonly used term for inheritance is specialisation and generalisation. A subclass is a specialisation of a superclass, and a superclass is a generalisation of one or more subclasses.[^2]
