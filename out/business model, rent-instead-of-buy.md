# Business Model, Rent-instead-of-Buy

The customer does not buy a product, but instead rents it. This lowers the capital typically needed to gain access to the product. The company itself benefits from higher profits on each product, as it is paid for the duration of the rental period. Both parties benefit from higher efficiency in product utilisation as time of non-usage, which unnecessarily binds capital, is reduced on each product.[^1]

## Notes

- Based on this insight, shouldn't they speak about users here?
- Also seems to have strong similarities to the sharing economy concept and [[Business Model, Fractional Ownership.
