# Business Model, Guaranteed Availability

Within this model, the availability of a product or service is guaranteed, resulting in almost zero downtime. The customer can use the offering as required, which minimises losses resulting from downtime. The company uses expertise and economies of scale to lower operation costs and achieve these availability levels.[^1]
