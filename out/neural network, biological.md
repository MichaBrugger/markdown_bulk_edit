# Neural Network, Biological

The brain contains more than 80 billion cells (neurons) which exchange information with one another via small pulses of electricity. One neuron doesn't talk directly with all 80 billion others. Rather, they are connected into structures that perform specialised functions. These structures are biological neural networks.
