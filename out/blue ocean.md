# Blue Ocean

Blue oceans are new, uncontested market spaces where the competition is irrelevant. In blue oceans, you invent and capture new demand, and you offer customers a leap in value while also streamlining your costs. Results? Handsome profits, speedy growth â€“ and brand equity that lasts for decades while rivals scramble to catch up.[^1]
