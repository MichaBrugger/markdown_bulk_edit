# Self-Service

A part of the value creation is handed over to the customer in exchange for a lower price of the service or product. This is particularly suited for process steps that add relatively low perceived value for the customer but cause high costs. Customers benefit from efficiency and time savings, while putting in their own effort. This can also increase efficiency, because in some cases the customer can execute a value adding step quicker and more effectively than the company.[^1]
