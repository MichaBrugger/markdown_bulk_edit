# Java Method Body

The method body is where all the action of a method takes place; the method body contains all the legal Java instructions that implement the method. Within the method body, you can use the this keyword to refer to the current object. The current object is the object whose method is being called. In addition, you can declare exclusive variables, that can only be used within the method.[^1]
