# Cellular Automaton

A Cellular Automaton is a [[discrete model of computation studied in automata theory. Cellular automata have found application in various areas, including physics, theoretical biology and microstructure modelling.

A cellular automaton consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off. The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its neighbourhood is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time t = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new generation is created (advancing t by 1), according to some fixed rule (generally, a mathematical function) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighbourhood. Typically, the rule for updating the state of cells is the same for each cell and does not change over time, and is applied to the whole grid simultaneously. The concept was originally discovered in the 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam and [[John von Neumann.[^1]

The arguably most famous cellular automaton is the Game of Life.
