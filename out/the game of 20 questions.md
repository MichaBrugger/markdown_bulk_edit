# The Game of 20 Questions

The game of 20 Questions is played between two players — the questioner and the answerer. It begins when the answerer picks an object. She does not reveal who or what she has thought of. Next, the questioner asks her a series of at most 2020 “Yes” or “No” questions, one after another. The answerer answers honestly. Finally, after asking at most 20 questions, the questioner is supposed to guess the object that the answerer initially picked. If he can guess correctly, he wins.
