# Notes on Interactive Evolution Simulator

I just watched this video on creating an evolution simulator.[^1] And I’m super hooked.

He has like a blob approach, seems super interesting. It’s actually “copied” from the YouTube Channel [[Primer. Where he simulates different scenarios with this simple setup, but is able to show and model quite complex interactions. In this video his blobs have different traits like size, sight and speed. Bigger blobs can eat smaller blobs, but they also use much more energy. One thing that really stuck with me was how that interaction was modelled: The energy lost per move (Sight + Size³ x Speed²) was actually modelled after the formula for kinetic energy (c+mv²).

> The speed of evolution is based on the selective pressures of the environment. This means: A larger amount of mutation doesn’t necessarily mean that evolution happens faster.

He explains this very well, using the example of larger and smaller blobs.
