# The Game of Life

The Game of Life is a [[Cellular Automaton that exists in two dimensions. It was invented by Cambridge mathematician [[Conway, John and became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.[^1] [^2]

The reason it's called the Game of Life is, that it's rules resemble some sort of biological process.

## Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
