# Abstractions in Computer Science

Multi-layer abstractions are everywhere in assembly instructions or machine instructions, and they are an extremely detailed way of writing programs that the chip itself understands.

In many languages, such as interpretation. In this process, the Python program acts as an interpreter that takes the Python code you write and figures out the appropriate machine instructions for that code.[^1]
