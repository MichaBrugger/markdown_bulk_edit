# Internal Focus, or Automation Focus

Historically the oldest dimension. Its core idea is to automate repetitive tasks in order to improve efficiency and thus its competitiveness. Always focusing on the return on investment. An example for a company coming from this area would be [[SAP (automation of routine work).[^1]

However, there are certain implications/problems with this approach. They are great to increase efficiency|, given the context is within one generation of technology and that the company keeps doing what it has done before (doesn't change its structure). Else, focusing on this approach might lead to legacy systems since it's often hard to justify an investment into completely new systems.

Given the declining ROI on automation, the endgame of internal digitization processes are generally an intelligent partial automation.[^2]
