# Principle of Similarity

An approach to business model pattern adaptation, going from the inside out. The adaptation process is begun by looking at the business models found in closely related industries, and then considering an ever-wider range of industries. The patterns found are then adapted to oneâ€™s own business model.[^1]

The principle of similarity in the context of Business Model Navigator is one of two principles applied in the Ideation stage. Its goal is to create business model innovation ideas by searching for analogies between your business model and patterns from other industries or companies facing a similar problem or challenge.[^2]

## Approach

1. Define the challenge
2. Search specific criteria
3. Search industry facing similar challenge
4. Analyse the applied business model pattern
5. Generate business model idea
