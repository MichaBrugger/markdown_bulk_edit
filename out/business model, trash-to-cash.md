# Trash-to-Cash

Used products are collected and either sold in other parts of the world or transformed into new products. The profit scheme is mainly based on low to no purchase prices. Resource costs for the company are almost eliminated and, at the same time, the supplierâ€™s waste disposal is actually provided, or associated costs are reduced. This also addresses potential environmental-awareness ideals that customers might have.[^1]
