# Industry 4.0, Horizontal Integration

Horizontal integration is one way to look at [[Industry 4.0.

If everything is connected to everything else in production, and every product I produce has a digital twin, then I'm able to optimise (seen over the whole production process). Currently, many companies only look at efficiency in one production facility, if the process is digital, it allows to increase efficiency horizontally (across production facilities). [^1]
