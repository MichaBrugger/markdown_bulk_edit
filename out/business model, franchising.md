# Business Model, Franchising

The franchisor owns the brand name, products and corporate identity, and these are licensed to independent franchisees who carry the risk of local operations. Revenue is generated as part of the franchiseesâ€™ revenue and orders. The franchisees benefit from the usage of well-known brands, their know-how and support.[^1]
