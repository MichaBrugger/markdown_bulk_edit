# Data Structures, Array

Arrays are a type of linear data structure that can hold an ordered collection of values. As opposed to the data type array, the array data structure specifies an implementation that the values are of homogeneous size and stored in contiguous memory. They are extremely ubiquitous and among the oldest, most widely used data structures in programming.[^1]
