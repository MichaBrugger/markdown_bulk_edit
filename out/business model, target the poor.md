# Target the Poor

The product or service offering does not target the premium customer, but rather the customer positioned at the base of the pyramid. Customers with lower purchasing power benefit from affordable products. The company generates small profits with each product sold, but benefits from the higher sales numbers that usually come with the scale of the customer base.[^1]

## Notes

Potential relation to [[Business Model, Robin Hood regarding the target market.
