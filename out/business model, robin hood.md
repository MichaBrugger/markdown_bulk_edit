# Robin Hood

The same product or service is provided to 'the rich' at a much higher price than to 'the poor'. Thus, the main bulk of profits are generated from the rich customer base. Serving ‘the poor’ is not profitable per-se, but creates economies of scale that other providers cannot achieve. Additionally, it has a positive effect on the company’s image.[^1]
