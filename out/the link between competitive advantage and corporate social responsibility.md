# The Link Between Competitive Advantage and Corporate Social Responsibility

[[Corporate Social Responsibility as inescapable priority for companies because of the rising publicity of rankings. Many companies already do a lot, but first, they pit business against society, when clearly, the two are interdependent. Second, they make companies think about CSR in Generic ways and not in the way most appropriate to each firm's strategy,

CSR can be much more than just a charitable deed or a constraint, it can be a source of zero sum game. Can become the source of tremendous social progress.

The attention CSR has received has not only been voluntary. Many companies woke up to certain problems and outbursts of the public to issues they didn't even think were within their business, such as Nike. While companies have come to realise these risks, they don't know what to do about them. Usually, an Sustainability report is written, rarely offering a coherent framework for CSR activities, let alone a strategic one.

Four Prevailing justifications for CSR:
Moral obligation
Be good citizens, do the right thing etc.

[[Sustainability
Environmental and community stewardship.

[[License to operate
Every company needs a tacit or explicit license from a government, communities or other Stakeholders, to do business.

[[Brand, Reputation
Strengthen brand, enliven morale, even raise value of stock.

All four schools share the same weakness, they focus on the tension between business and society rather than on their interdependence.
