# Difference Between Market-Creating Strategies and Customer-Oriented Approaches

The trouble is that managers, especially those in marketing, have been quite reasonably brought up to believe that the customer is king. It's all too easy for them to assume, therefore, that market-creating strategies are customer led, which causes them to reflexively stick to their focus on existing customers and how to make them happier.

This approach, however, is unlikely to create new markets. To do that, an organisation needs to turn its focus to non-customers and why they refuse to patronise an industry's offering. Non-customers, not customers, hold the greatest insight into the points of pain and intimidation that limit the boundary of an industry.
