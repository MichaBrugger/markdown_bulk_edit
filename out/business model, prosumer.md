# Prosumer

Companies enable customers to become producers themselves. The customer is integrated into the value chain and can profit from the resulting product, while the company has fewer investment costs for production and overheads. Since the consumer has a hand in production, the perceived value of the product increases.[^1]

## Notes

Connection between customer, user, prosumer and consumer.
