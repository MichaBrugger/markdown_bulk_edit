# Solution Provider

A service provider offers total coverage of products and services in a particular domain, consolidated via a single point of contact. Special know-how is given to the customer in order to increase his or her performance. By becoming a full service provider, a company can prevent revenue losses by extending its service and adding it to the product. Additionally, close contact with the customer allows great insight into customer habits and needs, which can be used to improve the products and services.[^1]

## Notes

This is very similar to the concept of a [[Ecosystem, Super Platform.
