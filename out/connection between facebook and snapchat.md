# Why Did Facebook Not Buy Snapchat?

Marc Zuckerberg made, just like in the WhatsApp case an initial offer of $10 billion, to which Evan Spiegel replied: “Thanks for your offer, but in 3 years we will buy you.” This destroyed the relationship between the two companies. Because they needed cash anyway, Snapchat went for an IPO. The IPO was extremely successful, however the strong growth prognosis did not come true. One of the main drivers for this was the aggressive targeting of Snapchat through Facebook, by copying their core functions/features. Only in recent years, Snapchat was somewhat able to recover and grow again. [^1]
