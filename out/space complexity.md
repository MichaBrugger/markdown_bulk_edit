# Computer Science, Space Complexity

The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely. Similar to time complexity, space complexity is often expressed asymptotically in big O notation, where n is a characteristic of the input influencing space complexity. [^1]
