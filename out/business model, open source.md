# Business Model, [[Open Source

In software engineering, the source code of a software product is not kept proprietary but is freely accessible for anyone. Generally, this could be applied for any technology details of any contribute to the product, but also use it for free as a sole user. Money is typically earned with services that are complementary to the product, such as consulting and support.[^1]

## Notes

- IBM as an open source contributor was also talked about in the Lex Friedman podcast with Donald Knuth.
- This has also been discussed negatively lately with companies that had issues because they rely on open source software ([[Log4J and [[JNDI incident).[^2]
