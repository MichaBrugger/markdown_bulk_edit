# Business Model, Long Tail

Instead of concentrating on blockbusters, the main bulk of revenues is generated through a Long Tail of niche products. Individually, these neither demand high volumes, nor allow for a high margin. If a vast variety of these products are offered in sufficient amounts, the small-scale profits can add up to a significant amount.[^1]

## Notes

There is most definitely a connection between [[Economies of Scale and Long Tail models.
