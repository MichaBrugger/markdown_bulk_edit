# User Value (also: B2C Customer Value)

From a user perspective, user value is what a user gets (benefits, quality, worth, utility) from the purchase and use of a product relative to what they have to give up or pay (price, costs, sacrifices), thus resulting in an attitude or an emotional bond towards the product.[^1]
