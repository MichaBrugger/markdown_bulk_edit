In short: Probably not. However, there are a few things a company can do to at least minimise the risk (this should always be seen in the context of [[VUCA, especially [[Uncertainty).

All successful established companies will sooner or later face the innovator's dilemma. Specifically, as companies focus on improving their products and services for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) customers, they exceed the needs of some customer segments and ignore the needs of others.

New entrants (for example start-ups can then successfully target those overlooked segments, gaining foothold by delivering more suitable functionality (often at lower prices). The currently dominant companies tend to not respond vigorously, since they are chasing after the more demanding and profitable customers and it's impossible to cover everything.

Entrants then move upmarket, delivering the value that the incumbents mainstream customers require, while preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants offerings in volume, disruption has occurred. By finding the application use and market, the new entrants advance rapidly and hit the steep part of the class mature markets of the incumbents and disrupting them.

# Notes

This is a classic case of [[Pick your Battlefield. There is no way that the incumbent can cover every possible option that could occur. The question is, if there is a point where players can be [[Too Big to Fail?
