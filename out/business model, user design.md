# User Design

Within user manufacturing, a customer is both the manufacturer and the consumer. As an example, an online platform provides the customer with the necessary support in order to design and merchandise the product, e.g., product design software, manufacturing services, or an online shop to sell the product. The customer benefits from the potential to realise entrepreneurial ideas without having to provide the required infrastructure. Revenue is then generated as part of the actual sales.[^1]

## Notes

Is a consumer the right 'over-category' for customers and users?
