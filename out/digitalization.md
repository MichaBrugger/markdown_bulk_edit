# Digitalization

There doesn't seem to be an actual consensus when it comes to the definition of this word-cluster.

Wikipedia defines Digitalization as the process in which aspects of social life are restructured around digital communication. In this sense, digitalization refers to enabling or improving processes by leveraging digital technologies and digitised data. [^1] While in my lectures and on other sources, Digitalization refers to creating a digital representation of physical objects or attributes.[^2]

Then there is also the related business model that is named the same. And it also shouldn't be confused with Digitization. #♻️
