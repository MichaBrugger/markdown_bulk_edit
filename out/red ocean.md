# Red Ocean

The term was coined in the context of the markets and industries that are relatively unattractive, because they are highly competitive and offer small margins. In red oceans, companies try to out-perform rivals to grab bigger slices of existing demand. As the space gets increasingly crowded, profit and growth prospects shrink. Products become commoditised. Ever-more-intense competition turns the water bloody.[^1]
