# Requirements Engineering, Analysis

Analysis is arguably the most important stage.
- Roughly 65% of all grave mistakes happen because of poor analysis.
- One of the main reason for failed [[Software Engineering projects are incomplete, inaccurate or changing goals or requirements (see [[Requirements, Creeping).
- The cost for correcting errors is very high and rises fast the later the error is discovered.

Thus, a high quality analysis of the requirements is absolutely key.[^1]
