# Why Are Requirements Hard to Specify?

- Objectives/goals of the project aren't clear
- The task to be solved is very complex
- Communication problems - There are language barriers between the different actors
- The objectives/goals of the project are constantly changing
- [[Requirements are poorly defined
- product has unnecessary features
- Inaccurate Planing and Tracking of the project due to inaccurate requirements.

To avoid these problems, we apply the techniques of [[Requirements Engineering and [[Requirements Management.

## Notes

This is more or less the 'negative version' of the good requirements list in the [[Software Requirements Specification.
