# Value Proposition Canvas

The VPCÂ can be used to create products and services, that customers want (it addresses the value gaps in the user journey cycle[^1]). It's a form of customer profile and the value map.[^2]

A fit is achieved by creating a clear connection between what matters to the customers and how the products and services offered ease pains and create gains. However, no matter how good the fit, it's important to understand that good value propositions always need to be integrated into scalable and profitable business models.[^3]
