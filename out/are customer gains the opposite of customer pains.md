# Are Customer Gains the Opposite of Customer Pains

Short answer: not really.

If the positive or negative result falls under the normal expectations of the customer then gains aren't really the opposite of pains.[^1] Pains and gains in this sense can be seen as a sort of non-binary continuum. Basically anything the customer perceives can be seen on this scale from gain over neutral to pain, or the other way around.
