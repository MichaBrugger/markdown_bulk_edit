# Central Processing Unit

A processor processes a program’s instructions. It can process only very simple instructions. The power of computing comes from speed and program intricacy.

## CPU Tasks

The CPU performs the fetch, decode, execute cycle to process programs.

- The CPU’s control unit fetches, from main memory, the next instruction in the sequence of program instructions.
- The instruction is encoded in the form of a number.
- The execution performs an action (e.g., sum two numbers)
