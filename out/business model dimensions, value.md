# Business Model Dimensions, Value

The profit mechanism â€“ why does it generate VALUE? This fourth dimension, which includes aspects such as cost structures and revenue-generating mechanisms, clarifies what it is that makes a business model financially viable. It provides an answer to the central question that every company needs to ask: how do we produce value for our shareholders and stakeholders? Or put more simply: why does the business model work commercially?[^1]
