# Connection Between Red Oceans and Military Strategy

There is a dramatic imbalance towards red oceans. Part of the explanation for that is that corporate strategy is heavily influenced by its roots in military strategy.

Described this way, strategy is all about red ocean competition. It is about confronting an opponent and driving him off a battlefield of limited territory. doing business where there is no competitor. It is about creating new land, not dividing up existing land. Focusing on the red ocean therefore means accepting the key constraining factors of war—limited terrain and the need to beat an enemy to succeed. And it means denying the distinctive strength of the business world—the capacity to create new market space that is uncontested.
