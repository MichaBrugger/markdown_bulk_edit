# Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Types in Java

- Primitive types are predefined in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for `String`).
- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
- A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
- A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter (naming conventions).
- The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
