# Difference Between Open and Closed Innovation

[[Open Innovation comes from [[Closed Innovation

The traditional innovation process is closed because projects can only enter it in one way, at the beginning from the company’s internal base, and can only exit in one way, by going into the market. In the open innovation model, by contrast, projects may enter or exit at various points and in various ways. Here, projects can be launched from either internal or external technology sources, and new technology can enter into the process at various stages—the outside-in portion of the model. In addition, projects can make their way to market in many ways as well, such as through out-licensing or via a spin-off venture company, in addition to going through the company’s own marketing and sales channels. This is the inside-out part of the model.
