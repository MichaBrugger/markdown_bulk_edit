# Ultimate Luxury

This pattern describes the strategy of a company to offer customers high-end solutions in return for maximum purchasing prices. Companies use high standards of quality or exclusive privileges in order to distinguish themselves from others and to attract customers willing to pay for the ‘ultimate premium’. The necessary investments for these differentiations are met by the relatively high prices that can be achieved which usually allows for very high margins.[^1]
