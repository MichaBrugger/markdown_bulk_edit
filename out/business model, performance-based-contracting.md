# Performance-based-Contracting

A productâ€™s price is not based upon its physical value, but on the performance or valuable outcome it delivers, in the form of a service. Special expertise and economies of scale result in lower production and maintenance costs of a product, which can be forwarded to the customer. Extreme variants of this model are represented by different operation schemes in which the product remains the property of, and is operated by, the company.[^2]

## Notes

There is a weird similarity to the fractional ownership model here.
