# The Game of 20 Questions, Strategy

Through a divide and conquer approach, it should be possible to find out the answer within 20 questions, given we chose the right strategy. The most consistent strategy is the 50/50 approach. Other approaches (here 75/25) are, over time, less likely to succeed.

This doesn't mean that you always want to play 20 Questions by asking questions that divide the possible candidates in half as evenly as possible. However, if you don't have any extra information about who your opponent is likely to guess, or if you value always needing a consistent number of questions, 50/50 splits are the best way to divide and conquer.
