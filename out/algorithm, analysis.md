# Algorithm, Analysis

In computer science, the analysis of algorithms is the process of finding the computational complexity of algorithms â€“ the amount of time, storage, or other resources needed to execute them. Usually, this involves determining a function that relates the length of an algorithm's input to the number of steps it takesor the number of storage locations it uses. [^1]

In computer science we generally use [[Big O Notation in order to classify algorithms according to how their runtime or space requirements grow as the input size grows. [^2]
