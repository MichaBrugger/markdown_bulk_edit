# Business Model, Freemium

The basic version of an company offering is given away for free, with the hope of eventually persuading the customers to pay for the premium version at a later date. The free offering is able to attract the highest number of customers possible for the company. The generally smaller number of paying, generate the revenue, which also cross-finances the free offering.[^1]
