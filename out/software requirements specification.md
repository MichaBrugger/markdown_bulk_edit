# Software Requirements Specification

A SRS is a description, how a software system should be developed. It generally lays out the functional and non-functional requirements and may include a set of use-cases that describe the user interactions.

A good SRS should be:[^1]
- Adequate: describing what the customer wants or needs
- Complete: describing everything the customer wants or needs
- Consistent: otherwise the specification can't be realised
- Comprehensive: for the customer and for the computer scientists
- Unambiguous: so that errors due to misinterpretation are avoided
- Verifiable: being able to determine whether the realised system meets the requirements
