# Business Model, Make More of It

Know-how and other available assets existing in the company are not only used to build own products, but are also offered to other companies. Slack resources, therefore, can be used to create additional revenue besides that which is generated directly from the core value proposition of the company.[^1]

## Notes

There is a potential connection to the franchise model here, regarding the sharing of know-how.
