# Business Model, Affiliation

The focus lies on supporting others to sell products and directly benefiting from successful transactions. Affiliates usually profit from some kind of pay-per-sale or pay-per-display compensation. The company, on the other side, is able to gain access to a more diverse potential customer base, without additional active sales or marketing efforts.[^1]
