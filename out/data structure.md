# Data Structure

In computer science, a data structure organisation, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification of data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to it.[^1]

Even though they sound similar in name and concept, it is not to be confused with the data type.
