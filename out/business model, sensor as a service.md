# Sensor as a Service

The use of sensors permits additional services for physical offerings, or wholly new independent services. It is not the sensor that generates the primary revenue, but the analysis of the data that the sensor creates. Possibilities for real-time information can further strengthen the value proposition.[^1]

Often in combination with the [[Internet of Things.
