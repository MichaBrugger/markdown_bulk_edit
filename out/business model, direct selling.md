# Business Model, Direct-Selling

Direct Selling is where a companyâ€™s products are not sold through intermediary channels but are available directly from the manufacturer or service provider. This way, the company skips the retail margin and any additional costs associated with the intermediates. These savings can be forwarded to the customer, while a standardised sales experience can be established. Additionally, the close contact can intensify the relationship with the customer base.[^1]
