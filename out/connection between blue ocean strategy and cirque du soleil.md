# Connection Between Blue Ocean Strategy and Cirque Du Soleil

An example of a blue ocean creation is new industry that combined elements from traditional circus with elements drawn from sophisticated theater. In just 20 years, Cirque raked in revenues that Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey-the world’s leading circus-needed more than a century to attain.

Cirque du Soleil omitted costly elements of traditional circus, such as animal acts and aisle concessions. Its reduced cost structure enabled it to provide sophisticated elements from theater that appealed to adult audiences – such as themes, original scores, and enchanting sets, all of which change year to year. The added value lured adults who had not gone to a circus for years and enticed them to come back more frequently – thereby increasing revenues. By offering the best of circus and theater, Cirque created a market space that, as yet, has no name – and no equals.[^1]
