# Business Model, Hidden Revenue

The logic that the user is responsible for the income of the business is abandoned. Instead, the main source of revenue comes from a third party, which cross-finances whatever free or low-priced offering attracts the users. A very common case of this model is financing through advertisement, where the attracted customers are valuable to the advertisers who fund the offering.[^1]

This concept facilitates the idea of separation between revenue and customer and is closely related to the business model of the big tech companies.
