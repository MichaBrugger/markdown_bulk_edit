# Main Memory (RAM)

While the main memory, also called RAM, is divided into units called bytes, it is usually measured in megabytes (as opposed to the [[Memory, Auxiliary which is usually measured in gigabytes). The main memory is used to store:

- The current program
- The data the program is using
- The results of intermediate calculations

It is volatile, which means that it's content is erased when the computer is turned off.[^1]

## Memory Address

Each byte in main memory resides at a numbered location called its address.[^1]
