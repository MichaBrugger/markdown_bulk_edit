# Java, Overloading

A Java class can have more than one constructor or contain more than one method with the same name, as long as both of them define a clearly distinguishable set of parameters.[^1]

Overloading is used to perform polymorphism in Java.

```java
public class Test{

  Object.method(parameter); // external
  method(parameter) // internal
} 


```
