# Managed Services Contract

Are a form of service bundling, related to the concept of outsourcing. Important, from a company point of view, is, that the company can provide the service cheaper than the customer itself, else the business model doesn't work. This can usually be achieved by partially automating and/or digitizing the product/service (see IoT devices).[^1]
