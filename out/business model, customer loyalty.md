# Business Model, Customer Loyalty

Customers and their loyalty are retained by providing them value beyond the actual product or service itself, i.e., through incentive-based programs. The goal is to increase loyalty by creating an emotional relationship, or simply rewarding it with special offers. Customers are voluntarily bound to the company, which protects future revenue.[^1]

## Notes

The emotional bond between customer and company could also be seen as a form of a [[Lock-in Effect.
